# Use bitly API PATH with Bash  (code BETA)

Automatization autoexecute of the file .sh bash each minute.


The IDEA was to update the URL When my ROUTER CHANGED of yout current IP (because it has a IP PUBLIC but random)
so when reboot my IP is posible that changed to other IP and I LOST my IP house IP


### WRONG

on bitly api rest  WE CAN'T update the field `long_url`


### Solution to no update the field: long_url

For moment only update the Title from ITEM LINK BITLY
Solution1: Udating the title I kwnon for for anyway that happend when Im away from home.
Solution2: To send me one mail  with this change
