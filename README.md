**PROBLEM:** My current public ip change all time
**SOLUTION:** Ceate script for update the URL bitly themelse i will always have access to my House Server

**TASK:** The function is check if our network has internet  
And if dont have create a varibale call: `UPDATE_API` with value 1  
Useful for next execution of this script Execute the PACTH bitly request.

## Wrong (i need access by auth 2 for to do this)

With bitly api rest  WE CAN'T update the field `long_url`  
I realized than when i started to write ( bad practice :( )

## Solution to no update the field: long_url

For moment only update the Title from ITEM LINK BITLY

Solution2: To send me one mail  with this change
